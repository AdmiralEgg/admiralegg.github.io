Work in Progress.

- Ask what happened
- Step back and leave it before you react
- Look before you leap - 'What has happened? Why?'
- Designers need to win every design conversation, but the best designers spark others.
- Not the problem that defines you, it's your reaction.
- 'Design is broken, what can we do to fix it?'
- You can't be the unreasonable one.
- Deliver documentation that's readable and engaging.
- Engage team with documentation, take it to the team, run through it, make sure they understand it. Early meeting for feedback and questions.
