Work in Progress.

- Rotation was a challenge. Dot product, player front and back.
- Debugging lines in game
- Wrap around rotation.

- Design; constrained to specific points. This allows the player to complete the puzzle fast when they know the answer.

- Puzzle growth, future puzzles merged other puzzles. Light beams could make symbols on the walls visible.
- Puzzle feedback, too many mechanics introduced too quickly.
