Hi, I'm Chris. Welcome to my portfolio website!

On this site you shall find a bunch of projects, many of which are available to download and play. Have a go, and if you find anything of interest, please contact me!

There are a growing number of articles taken from notes along my journey as a game developer, and I'll be adding more soon.

My aspiration is to make small, simple, well designed Indie games with like-minded people. If you are interested in working with me, get in touch!
